How It Works
The Portfolio Website is built using a combination of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. The projects are displayed in a grid format, and clicking on a project can lead to a detailed view or a link to the project itself. The contact form includes basic validation to ensure users enter the required information.
